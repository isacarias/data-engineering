### Data Pipeline for Female Literacy Rates Analysis

#### Project Overview
This project showcases how to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data on female literacy rates from the World Bank API. The primary goal is to use this data alongside other datasets to create a data analysis dashboard that highlights gender disparities in the STEM fields, focusing particularly on Latin America.

#### Features
* Data Extraction: Utilizes the World Bank API to programmatically pull data about adult female literacy rates globally from 2000 to 2023.
* Data Transformation: Includes steps for cleaning and structuring the data for analysis.
* Data Analysis: Aimed at integrating this dataset into a larger analysis focusing on gender disparities in STEM education and careers. This study will be focused on the Latin American region.
